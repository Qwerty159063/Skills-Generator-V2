**How to use**

When downloading the plugin you will see a little button with a skills icon with a weel on it. Click it.

Then you will see a menu, here you can check the checkboxes that you feel like doing. 

For example you check the pvm checkbox and click generate. It will then automaticly create a randomly generated task for you.

If you need help you can always click the wiki button to be able to go to the wiki of the current task.

When you have your task completed you can click the completed button and then you will get a point. (in the config settings you can check a checkbox to be able to get the c engineer completed sound when clicking this button.

When you have completed a task you can generate a new one!
